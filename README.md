    A simple NLP pipeline to classify Zomato reviews as positive/negative using Logistic Regression. If the dataset is missing, the script generates a small synthetic dataset automatically. Also produces a word cloud of frequent terms.

    ## Features
    - Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
- Logistic Regression classification with TF-IDF features
- Word cloud visualization saved in `results/`

    ## Requirements
    - Python 3.9+

    ## Setup & Usage
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python main.py
    ```

    Outputs are saved to the `results/` folder.
